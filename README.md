# BIRT
The open source Eclipse BIRT reporting and data visualization project. 

## Compiling ðŸ¤ž
Firstly, good luck. The branch `BIRT_4_5_Branch` which we use is old and some of the dependencies are no longer available on the internet, so we are only able to compile some projects rather than BIRT as a whole.

| Project | Compiles? |
| --- | :---: |
| uk.co.spudsoft.birt.emitters.excel | âœ” |
| org.eclipse.birt.report.engine | âœ– |

## BIRT artifacts used in CTC ðŸ¤¯
There are 2 artifacts in the reports.pu. 

The _runtime_ contains the actual java classes with any of our tweaks, such as changes to `uk.co.spudsoft.birt.emitters.excel`.
```
<groupId>com.gresham</groupId>
<artifactId>org.eclipse.birt.runtime</artifactId>
```

The _war_ is the web application that contains the runtime jar described above, amongst all the other BIRT jars.
```
<groupId>com.gresham</groupId>
<artifactId>birt.war</artifactId>
```

## Testing changes in CTC ðŸ’¥
It is quick to make a change in BIRT and get it into a running CTC reports PU.
1. Compile changes for `uk.co.spudsoft.birt.emitters.excel` (or your favourite project you are working in)
1. Find your modified classes in `uk.co.spudsoft.birt.emitters.excel/target/`
1. Find `ctcserver/xap/gigaspaces-xap-premium-12.3.0-ga/deploy/reports/WEB-INF/lib/org.eclipse.birt.runtime-4.5.0-10-SNAPSHOT.jar` (actual version may vary)
1. Copy the modified classes into the jar
1. Restart the reports PU (takes 30-60 seconds).

## Preparing and Uploading to Nexus ðŸ“¦
Once happy with the changes they can be uploaded to Nexus. This is done by modifying the latest runtime jar, runtime pom and birt war and uploading with a new version. 

1. Download the latest release version of these artifacts from the `thirdparty-maven-releases` Nexus repo
1. Rename the jar, pom and war to the next snapshot. Open the runtime pom and update the version. The 4.5.0 at the start of the version should remain as we are patching this version
1. Similar to the testing steps above, copy the modified classes into the runtime jar
1. Replace the modified runtime jar within the birt war `/WEB-INF/lib/` directory.
1. The 2 artifacts can be uploaded in either order. The properties you need to think about are:
    - `version`: the next snapshot / release
    - `url`: the nexus url to either `thirdparty-maven-snapshots` or `thirdparty-maven-releases`
    - `repositoryId`: this is a reference to credentials in your maven `settings.xml`. The value should probably be `snapshots` or `releases`.
    
    ```
    mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=com.gresham -DartifactId=org.eclipse.birt.runtime -Dversion=4.5.0-10-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=org.eclipse.birt.runtime-4.5.0-10-SNAPSHOT.jar -DpomFile=org.eclipse.birt.runtime-4.5.0-10-SNAPSHOT.pom -DrepositoryId=snapshots -Durl=https://nexus.greshamtech.com/repository/thirdparty-maven-snapshots/
    
    mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=com.gresham -DartifactId=birt.war -Dversion=4.5.0-10-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=war -Dfile=birt.war-4.5.0-10-SNAPSHOT.war -DrepositoryId=snapshots -Durl=https://nexus.greshamtech.com/repository/thirdparty-maven-snapshots/
    ```

## Referencing new artifacts in CTC ðŸ”¢
In the CTC server.parent pom, change the `birt.version` property to the version of the new artifacts. A `mvn clean install` on the reports.pu project will create a new war, which can be copied and pasted into a distribution or running server. Maybe even consider running the tests such as `BirtReportsEngineTest`.

## Releasing ðŸŽ‰
1. Rename your jar and war by removing `-SNAPSHOT`
1. Update the version within the runtime pom
1. Put the release jar into the war and remove the snapshot jar
1. Upload artifacts to Nexus
1. Update the artifact version in the server.parent pom.

Congratulations! You deserve a trip on The Matthew for getting this far.

## Gotchas ðŸ¤”
- If you forget to upload the pom file alongside the runtime jar, then our tests will fail as there will be many missing dependencies and you'll receive a class not found on CoreException.
